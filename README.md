My Ti-99/4A emulator, getting back to my very first computer :)

It's a simple and easy/light Windows program, pure C.
CPU is complete, TMS9918 is working well enough including sprites and collisions (to be improved but ok), audio is limited to one channel and duration is fixed, keyboard and joystick are ok
Cycle accuracy was not taken into account, but there are 3 different settings for emulated CPU

Some ROMs are added as C arrays, mostly for testing purposes.
